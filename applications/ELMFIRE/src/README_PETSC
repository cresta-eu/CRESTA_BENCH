# This file describes briefly how to build PETSc 3.2 libraries on ARCHER (Cray XC30)
#

1. PRE-CONFIGURATION:

   The CRESTA Benchmark Suite is using the Intel compiler to compile ELMFIRE, so the  Intel 
   environment should also be used to build PETSc libraries. Cmake is also needed. 

            module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-intel 
 	    module load cmake
  
   Once inside the petsc-3.2-p7 directory set PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH
   	   e.g.:   
    	       	   export PETSC_DIR=`pwd`
    		   export PETSC_ARCH=archer_intel    

2. CONFIGURATION :

   Configure with the following options:

    ./configure 
    	--with-cc=cc 
	--with-cxx=CC 
	--with-fc=ftn 
	--with-batch=1 
	--known-mpi-shared-libraries=0 
	--with-clib-autodetect=0 
	--with-cxxlib-autodetect=0 
	--with-fortran-autodetect=0 
	--with-debugging=0 
	--with-shared-libraries=0 
	--with-ranlib=ranlib 
	COPTFLAGS="-O3 -xavx -fPIC" 
	CXXOPTFLAGS="" 
	FOPTFLAGS="-O3 -xavx -fPIC" 
	--with-dynamic-loading=0 
	--with-pthread=0

   The configuration will provide the information about reconfiguration 
          e.g. :

=================================================================================   
Since your compute nodes require use of a batch system or mpiexec you must:  
1) Submit ./conftest-archer_intel to 1 processor of your batch system or system you 
are cross-compiling for; this will generate the file reconfigure.py              
2) Run ./reconfigure-archer_intel.py (to complete the configure process).                    
=================================================================================

   You can do this using the provided conftest.pbs file. If your PETSC_ARCH is
   different than archer_intel then you need to modify the conftest.pbs file 
   changing conftest-archer_intel to conftest-your_PETSC_ARCH. Then submit the 
   script : 

    	   	 qsub conftest.pbs

   After the job finished running reconfigure:
      	  e.g. :
      	      	 ./reconfigure-archer_intel.py


3. BUILD :

   !! IMPORTANT NOTE !!
   Before following the build instructions on ARCHER you need to ‘scrub the headers’. 
   This is a system specific step and currently is only necessary on Cray systems. This may
   not be required on other machines.
   
   The provided script scrub_headers.sh will take care of that. Run it on PETSC_ARCH
   directory :

     	       ./scrub_headers.sh archer_intel  


   Than follow the build instructions 
          e.g. :
	       make PETSC_DIR=/work/.../ELMFIRE/src/petsc-3.2-p7 PETSC_ARCH=archer_intel all



4. TESTING

   Since the compute nodes are using the batch system it is not possible to run make 
   test directly to verify whether the libraries were installed correctly. You can run 
   make test   
   	e.g. :
   	       make PETSC_DIR=/work/.../ELMFIRE/src/petsc-3.2-p7 PETSC_ARCH=archer_intel test

   and then copy the compile and link options and run them inside src/snes/examples/tutorials. 
   Once the executables are created modify the PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH accordingly inside the 
   examples.pbs script and then submit it to the backend.

   If the examples run correctly the libraries have been installed properly.
