- new feature: (implemented by Sebastian von Alfthan)
      	       the result element may now contain a title, which will be
               printed above the according result table, and a transpose
	       section, which transposes the table.

	       Example:
	       <result>
	       <show colw="10" title="Real Cycle and Time Accounting (%)" transpose="yes">
	       	     Domain_dec,Send_X_PME,Comm_coord,Neigh_srch,Force,Wait_Cmm_F,
	       	     PME_mesh,Wait_Cm_XF,Wait_Rx_PF,Write_traj,Update,Constrnts,Comm_energ,Rest
	       </show>

	       <sort>
		ncpus	
	       </sort>

	       </result>

	       Will result in the following table:

	       Real Cycle and Time Accounting (%)
	        Subid:     |  n44p8t1_t001_i01  n88p8t1_t001_i01

patch level 15
- A default column width of colw="10" is used if the attribute is not
  specified in result.xml

05.03.2009: AS
patch level: 14
- new feature: It's now possible to define the column width for the
               result tables. As of now a new attribute called colw has
               to be defined in result.xml. 
	       Example:  <show active="1" colw="10"> ...</show>
               If you do not set the column width jube will terminate with
	       an error message.
	       Thanks go to Jon Hill for this adaption


14.01.2009: AS
patch level: 13
 - jube adds a header to xml-longlog-files. Combined with jube_report.xsl and style.css
   which are copied to xmllogs/ it is now possible to regard the longlog files in your 
   browser provided with an formatted style. Please choose Firefox or Windows IE because
   parsing xsl-files is not supported by all browsers yet. Please make sure that your
   browser recognizes that your longlog file is a xml file.
   usage example:  firefox <whatever.longlog>

26.11.2008: LA
patch level: 12
 - add new function: predefparams; it allows to read in the top level xml-file
   parameter out of a choosen section

04.11.2008: WF
patch level: 11
 - add precommand in analyse tag: command will be executed before 
   verify and pattern analysis

02.11.2008: FJ
patch level: 10
 - jube adds the content of platform.xml to the xmllog for
   the chosen platform. 

30.10.2008: AS
patch level: 9
 - jube prints out the xml-file names when processing them.
   If there is a mistake in these files the user now knows
   where to look for the problem.

27.10.2008: AS
patch level: 8
 - 'index' has been modified. It is used in analyse.xml via the attribute 
   'mode' in order to extract data out of a table. 'index' takes a table 
   from input and writes out columns choosen by the user through indeces 
   and puts them into the xmllog file.


23.10.2008: WF
patch level: 7
 - new option '-showall' shows all benchmark runs in result table, 
   shows also queued and failed runs
 - new feature: multiple output tables in result:
   <show>...</show> can be repeated in result.xml
   <sort>...</sort> can also be repeated, if not, sort order will 
   be the same for all tables
 - result.xml: active option to show- and sort- tag implemented
	       e.g.: <show active="1"> ...
		     <sort active="0"> ...

17.10.2008: AS
patch level: 6
 - modification of the -cmpdir option. This option allows
   for setting a compile directory other than the home/
   directory. This option works with a single compilation
   and with a bunch of compilations as well. Each
   compilation takes place in an unique subdirectories. The
   option -cmpdir can also be used together with the option
   -tmpdir. JuBE creates a tar ball of the source files and
   transfers it to the corresponding subdirectory in the 
   directory chosen by -tmpdir.

14.10.2008: AS
patch level: 5
 - if the start_info.xml file and end_info.xml file
   respectively don't exist in the end of a calculation 
   a hint will be added to the output while updating the 
   results via the option -update.

01.10.2008: AS
patch level: 4
 - new command line option -cmpdir added:
   can be used in the compile step to choose another
   directory for compilation than the home/ directory.
   In the end the new executable will be copied to the
   home/ directory as well

16.09.2008: SM
patch level: 3
 - nbench has been changed to JuBE

31.03.2008: WF
patch level: 2
- new tag <input> in analyse.xml:
  <analyse cname="SGI-Altix">
      <input addfiles="log/load_0001.dat log/load_0001.dat" />
      <includepattern file="./analyse-pattern-pepc.xml" /> 
  </analyse>
  All files specified in the addfile attribute of this tag will be 
  appended to the analyse data (stderr and stdout). The contents of the 
  addfiles attribute can be a comma or blank delimited list of files. 
  If the filename is not starting with a / the execution directory of 
  benchmark run will be automatically prepended to the filename.

23.01.2008: WF
patch level: 1 
 - new command line option -tmpdir added:
   for specifying a directory containing all files 
   needed during runtime of a benchmark
   can be used, if benchmark directory resides on a filesystem
    which is not mounted on the compute nodes
   stdout/err will be temporally stored in $TMPdir/logs 
   and moved later by nbench (-update option) to the logs
   directory in the benchmark suite
 - first enhancements for logging compile parameters when using
   reuse option
